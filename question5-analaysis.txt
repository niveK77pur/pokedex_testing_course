--------------------- Instruction Coverage Score ---------------------

I got the instruction coverage score by adding the jacoco plugin to
the 'build.gradle' configuration. I then ran
    'gradle jacocoTestReport'
It will generate a report found in
    build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html

The total coverage indicated is 24%.

---------- Analysis on instruction and branch coverage score ---------

Disclaimer: I have not added tests to reach 100% instruction coverage.
    I would have needed to install and setup Eclipse solely to answer
    this, which seemed like not worth the trouble for me. The gradle
    jacoco report I used above did not provide simple access to
    coverage scores for individual lines. However, given the meaning
    of both scores, this question was possible to answer without
    coding anything.

Instruction coverage score essentially informs us on how many lines of
code were effectively covered by our tests. Branch coverage on the
other hand indicates how many branches have been covered; a branch
being for a example the different blocks/paths an if or switch
statement could take depending on its conditions.

That said, if we have 100% instruction coverage we have covered every
line of code using our tests. However, we may have not covered every
branch in our code (i.e. not all conditions for the branches were
tackled). It is thus possible to have covered every line, but still
miss branches due to uncovered conditions.

Obtaining 100% branch coverage could therefore be obtained using
parametrized tests. It will essentially extend the tests for
instruction coverage such that all branches are being tested as well.
